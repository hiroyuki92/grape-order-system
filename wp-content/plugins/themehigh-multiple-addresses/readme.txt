**üî• #1 Plugin to Ship WooCommerce Orders to Multiple Addresses**

With default WooCommerce functionality, shoppers can only ship to a single address per order. This not only affects the customer experience but also adds complexity for store owners managing multiple delivery requests.

That‚Äôs precisely why we built **Multiple Shipping Addresses for WooCommerce (Address Books) by ThemeHigh**. As the name suggests, this plugin empowers your customers to ship items from a single order to multiple addresses‚Äîquickly and effortlessly.

Using **Multiple Shipping Addresses for WooCommerce** you can:

‚ú≥Ô∏è Save multiple billing and shipping addresses to their Address book

‚ú≥Ô∏è Ship different products to multiple addresses in a single purchase

This plugin works smoothly with other popular **[ThemeHigh checkout plugins](https://www.themehigh.com/product/woocommerce-checkout-field-editor-pro/)** allowing you to build a powerful, user-friendly checkout experience.

**üöÄ How to Get Started:**

 Install and activate the plugin, and proceed to:

 **Dashboard ‚ü∂ WooCommerce ‚ü∂ Manage Address**

From there, you can:

‚úÖ ENABLE MULTIPLE BILLING ADDRESSES

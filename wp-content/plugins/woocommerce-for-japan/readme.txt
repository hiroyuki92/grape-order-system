== Changelog ==

= 2.9.14 - 2026-06-22 =
* **Fixed** - Paidy payment verification was always failing (HTTP 404) because the gateway incorrectly used POST for `GET /payments/{id}`; switched to `wp_safe_remote_get()` so payment status checks now succeed and order completion is unblocked
* **Security** - `payment_id` parameter is now validated against the Paidy format (`pay_[A-Za-z0-9_]+`) and `rawurlencode()`-escaped before being interpolated into the API URL, preventing path/query injection from buyer-controllable transaction IDs
* **Fixed** - Paidy payment_id regex was too strict (rejected underscores); updated to `pay_[A-Za-z0-9_]+` to match actual Paidy IDs such as `pay_aii8_kYAAEYA2BDW`

= 2.9.13 - 2026-05-27 =
* **Security** - Fixed Broken Access Control (CVSS 6.5) in Paidy payment gateway REST endpoints: `paidy-receiver/v1/receive` now enforces a one-time per-session state token (stored as a per-token transient keyed by the 32-char value itself so parallel sessions cannot clobber each other); `paidy/v1/order` and `paidy/v1/check` now require either HMAC signature verification or an IP allowlist — the previous unconditional `return true` fallback has been removed
* **Security** - State token parameter is validated for type and format (32-char alphanumeric) before use as a transient key suffix to prevent non-string or oversized inputs on the unauthenticated receiver endpoint
* **Security** - State transient is consumed only after the handler completes successfully so transient DB / decryption failures do not permanently prevent retrying the onboarding callback; orphaned transients are cleaned up when `wp_remote_post()` fails
* **Fixed** - WP_Error messages for base64 and AES-256-CBC decryption failures in the Paidy receiver are now translatable via `__()` / `sprintf()` with a `%s` field-name placeholder
* **Fixed** - Missing Paidy API key fields (absent from the intermediary POST) are now merged into `$filtered_params` as empty strings so downstream code can access all four key fields unconditionally without undefined-index notices

= 2.9.12 - 2026-05-21 =
* **Fixed** - Yomigana (reading) fields duplicated on My Account address edit form when block checkout is active; `woocommerce_address_to_edit` filter now removes `_wc_{type}/jp4wc/yomigana_*` duplicates when traditional `{type}_yomigana_*` fields are already present (classic checkout), and suppresses traditional fields when only WC Additional Fields API keys are registered (block checkout)
* **Fixed** - Yomigana rows duplicated on My Account Addresses view page (`/my-account/?edit-address`) for both classic and block checkout; WC Additional Fields API `render_address_fields` callback is now removed before it fires when JP4WC yomigana is enabled, eliminating the extra "Last Name ( Yomigana )" label rows
* **Fixed** - My Account Addresses view page did not display yomigana for block checkout users whose data is stored only in `_wc_billing/jp4wc/yomigana_*` meta keys; `formatted_address()` now reads both classic (`{type}_yomigana_*`) and block (`_wc_{type}/jp4wc/yomigana_*`) meta keys, selecting the set that matches the active checkout type
* **Fixed** - `{last_name}`, `{first_name}`, and `{yomigana_*}` placeholders appeared as literal text in the Block Checkout address summary; address format filter now correctly handles block checkout context
* **Changed** - Removed unused PayPal Express Checkout (`ppec_paypal`) compatibility code that referenced a decommissioned gateway

= 2.9.11 - 2026-05-11 =
* **Fixed** - Fatal error in `jp4wc_delivery_check_data()` on Classic Checkout with Square / Amazon Pay; `woocommerce_payment_successful_result` was registered with 1 argument so `$result['order_id']` was undefined when gateways omit it — `wc_get_order(null)` returned false, causing a PHP Fatal Error on `$order->get_meta()` and corrupting the AJAX redirect to the Thank You page; filter now accepts 2 arguments and `$order_id` arrives as the second parameter; added early-return guard when `wc_get_order()` returns false (Closes #166)
* **Fixed** - Yomigana (reading) fields no longer appeared in order emails after 2.9.10; restored accidentally removed `woocommerce_localisation_address_formats` filter registration that injects `{yomigana_last_name}` / `{yomigana_first_name}` placeholders into the JP address format template
* **Changed** - "NOT registered" delivery log messages changed from `log_info` to `log_debug` (WP_DEBUG only) to stop a 2 MB/day log flood on sites with delivery date disabled
* **Changed** - Removed unused `display_admin_order_meta()` method in `JP4WC_Delivery` that was never registered to any hook (dead code since introduction)

= 2.9.10 - 2026-04-27 =
* **Security** - `jp4wc_hide_notices()` now requires `manage_woocommerce` capability before processing notice-dismissal requests
* **Fixed** - Admin order edit page displayed 名|姓 instead of 姓|名; CSS overrides now swap float directions for first/last name fields to restore the correct Japanese display order
* **Fixed** - Admin order address field CSS was not applied on HPOS screens; enqueue now covers all screen ID variants including `admin_page_wc-orders` and uses a `$_GET['page']` fallback for early-init cases
* **Fixed** - JP4WC admin CSS was overridden by WooCommerce's cascade; inline styles are now attached directly after `woocommerce_admin_styles` at `admin_enqueue_scripts` priority 20 to guarantee the overrides take effect
* **Improved** - Admin address field ordering rewritten with an order-list approach that preserves fields injected by third-party plugins and guards against yomigana field duplication
* **Improved** - Admin settings panel: Classic Checkout settings (Company name, Zip auto-entry, Free shipping display) grouped under a dedicated section; added PRO notice for Block Checkout zip auto-entry
* **Changed** - Removed unused `woocommerce_billing_fields`/`woocommerce_shipping_fields` filter and streamlined yomigana field handling in address replacements

= 2.9.9 - 2026-04-23 =
* **Fixed** - COD fee not applied in Classic Checkout (Shortcode) or Block Checkout because `jp4wc_calculate_order_totals` read from `woocommerce_cod_settings` while the JP4WC admin UI saves to `wc4jp-extra_charge_*` options; settings are now merged at runtime with JP4WC values taking precedence
* **Fixed** - `extra_charge_calc_taxes` mismatch: React admin UI stored `yes`/`no` but PHP expected `no-tax`/`tax-excl`/`tax-incl`; legacy values are now normalised on read and the admin UI updated to a 3-way select
* **Fixed** - Stale `jp4wc_gateway_id` session value could cause COD fee to be silently skipped in Classic Checkout (double session-check removed; gateway ID resolved once and passed through the entire calculation)
* **Improved** - Block Checkout fee script now uses exponential back-off retry (100 ms → 10 s) instead of fixed 1500 ms / 3000 ms timeouts to wait for `wc/store/payment` store readiness
* **Added** - PRO-ready filter hooks for COD fee: `jp4wc_cod_fee_settings`, `jp4wc_cod_fee_name`, `jp4wc_cod_fee_amount`, `jp4wc_cod_fee_is_applicable`, `jp4wc_cod_fee_tax_class` (all `@since 2.9.8`)
* **Changed** - Minimum required PHP version raised from 8.1 to 8.3

= 2.9.6 - 2026-04-22 =
* **Fixed** - Paidy webhook permission check rejected all notifications from Paidy (no `x-paidy-signature` header) causing orders to remain "pending" and be auto-cancelled
* **Fixed** - Paidy webhook signature verification used wrong option name `secret_key` (non-existent); corrected to `api_secret_key` / `test_api_secret_key` based on test mode
* **Fixed** - Bank transfer (`bankjp`) account skip condition `! isset( $account_names[$i] )` was always false; replaced with `empty( $bank_names[$i] ) && empty( $name )` to properly skip blank rows
* **Added** - Deduplication of bank transfer account entries on save and load to prevent double display caused by corrupted option data
* **Fixed** - Yomigana (読み仮名) fields not displayed in HTML emails when using Block Checkout; corrected meta key fallback from `_wc_other/` to `_wc_billing/` and `_wc_shipping/` prefixes
* **Fixed** - Yomigana displayed twice on order received (thank-you) page when using Block Checkout
* **Fixed** - Yomigana appearing as a separate bold `<strong>` list below the formatted address in emails and thank-you page; now suppressed via `show_in_order_confirmation: false` and block render filter
* **Fixed** - "(よみがなを確認するには「編集」をクリックしてください。)" message incorrectly appearing in new order emails
* **Fixed** - Customer email salutation showing first name only instead of full name (姓名); email context detection now uses `WC_Email::$sending` flag for reliability with WC 10.7+ BlockEmailRenderer
* **Added** - Country is hidden from formatted address in emails and thank-you page when the store sells to only one country

= 2.9.5 - 2026-04-20 =
* **Fixed** - White screen on frontend caused by fatal error in Paidy blocks support when gateway is not registered
* **Fixed** - `WC_Gateway_Paidy not found` fatal error on admin pages when WooCommerce is installed with a non-standard path (e.g. wp-env)
* **Fixed** - `jp4wc_has_orders_in_last_5_days` undefined function error caused by `is_woocommerce_active()` returning false in non-standard install paths
* **Fixed** - Google Calendar consultation button not displaying on some hosting environments (Xserver) due to CSP/WAF blocking external script injection; replaced with a plain link
* **Added** - `jp4wc_allowed_setting_keys` filter to allow add-on plugins to register their own setting keys with the REST API
* **Added** - `jp4wc_setting_option_map` filter to allow add-on plugins to map REST keys to their existing WordPress option names
* **Added** - `jp4wc.settings.tabs` and `jp4wc.settings.tabContent` JS filters via `@wordpress/hooks` to allow add-on plugins to inject tabs into the React settings UI

= 2.9.0 & 2.9.4 - 2026-03-19 =
* **Fixed** - COD fee not calculating in Classic Checkout due to `is_admin()` returning true for admin-ajax.php requests
* **Fixed** - COD fee showing for non-COD payment methods in Classic Checkout (stale session value)
* **Fixed** - COD fee incorrectly displayed on cart page (now checkout-only)
* **Fixed** - Delivery date/time fields not appearing in Checkout Block (changed `class_exists` to `interface_exists` for IntegrationInterface)
* **Fixed** - Delivery select placeholder showing WooCommerce auto-generated text instead of admin-configured label
* **Fixed** - Paidy order completion hook firing multiple times (added `paidy_capture_id` guard)
* **Fixed** - `_load_textdomain_just_in_time` warning in WordPress 6.7+ by deferring translations to after `init`
* **Fixed** - `JP4WC_Framework` config strings now lazy-loaded at `init` priority 2 to prevent early textdomain calls
* **Fixed** - `WC_Paidy_Endpoint` instantiation deferred to `init` priority 11 to prevent early `WC_Gateway_Paidy` construction
* **Removed** - PayPal settings removed from admin settings UI and API
